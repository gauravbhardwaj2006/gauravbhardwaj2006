    , Milkha Singh remains one of India's greatest athletes.

Born on<ins style="text-decoration-color:white"> 20 November 1929</ins> into a Sikh family in Govindpura, which is now a part of Pakistan,
    Milkha Singh was introduced to the sport only after he had fled to India post the partition
    and joined the Indian Army.

It was there that he sharpened his running skills. After he finished sixth in a cross-country race that
    had around 400 more soldiers running, he was handpicked for further training.
    That laid the foundation for what would be an impressive career.

His first Olympic Games came at Melbourne <ins style="text-decoration-color:white">1956</ins>, where an inexperienced Milkha Singh didn't progress beyond
    the heat stages in either the 200m or 400m, but a meeting with champion Charles Jenkins proved to be the
    source of much inspiration.<br><hr>

    the sport while serving in the Indian Army. He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games.
    He has won gold medals in the<ins style="text-decoration-color:white"> 1958</ins> and<ins style="text-decoration-color:white"> 1962</ins> Asian Games.

<p style="background-image: url('indiaflag.jpg');color:white">Milkha Singh was born on<ins style="text-decoration-color:white"> 20 November 1929</ins>, into a Sikh Rathore Rajput family.
    His birthplace was Govindpura, a village 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab Province,
    British India (now Kot Adu district, Pakistan). He was one of 15 siblings,
    eight of whom died before the Partition of India. He was orphaned during the Partition when his parents,
    a brother and two sisters were killed in the violence that ensued. He witnessed these killings.

Escaping the troubles in Punjab, where killings were continuing, by moving to Delhi, India, in<ins style="text-decoration-color:white"> 1947</ins>,
    Singh lived for a short time with the family of his married sister and was briefly imprisoned at
    Tihar jail for travelling on a train without a ticket. His sister, Ishvar, sold some jewellery to
    obtain his release.He spent some time at a refugee camp in Purana Qila and at a
    resettlement colony in Shahdara, both in Delhi.
Milkha became disenchanted with his life and considered becoming a dacoit[b] but was instead
    persuaded by one of his brothers, Malkhan, to attempt recruitment to the Indian Army.
    He successfully gained entrance on his fourth attempt, in<ins style="text-decoration-color:white"> 1951</ins>, and while stationed at
    the Electrical Mechanical Engineering Centre in Secunderabad and he was introduced to
    athletics. He had run the 10 km distance to and from school as a child and was selected by
    the army for special training in athletics after finishing sixth in a compulsory cross-country
    run for new recruits. Singh has acknowledged how the army introduced him to sport, saying
    that "I came from a remote village, I didn't know what running was, or the Olympics".</p><hr>

<p>Milkha represented India in the 200 m and 400 m competitions of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.
    His inexperience meant that he did not progress from the heat stages but a meeting with the eventual
    400 m champion at those Games, Charles Jenkins, both inspired him to greater things and provided him
    with information about training methods.

In 1958, Singh set records for the 200 m and 400 m in the National Games of India, held at Cuttack,
    and also won gold medals in the same events at the Asian Games. He then won a gold medal in the 400 m

    (440 yards at this time) competition at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games with a time of
    46.6 seconds. This latter achievement made him the first gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games
    from independent India. Before Vikas Gowda won the gold in 2014, Milkha was the only Indian male
    to have won an individual athletics gold medal at those Games.

Singh won the British AAA Championships title at the 1960 AAA Championships. Singh was persuaded by
    Jawaharlal Nehru to set aside his memories of the Partition era to race successfully in 1960
    against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan, where a post-race comment by the then General Ayub Khan led to
    him acquiring the nickname of The Flying Sikh.Some sources say that he set a world record of
    45.8 seconds in France, shortly before the Rome Olympics in the same year but the official
    report of the Games lists the record holder as Lou Jones, who ran 45.2 at Los Angeles in 1956.
    At those Olympics, he was involved in a close-run final race in the 400 m competition, where he
    was placed fourth.Singh had beaten all the leading contenders other than Otis Davis,
    and a medal had been anticipated because of his good form. However, he made an error when leading
    the race at 250 m, slowing down in the belief that his pace could not be sustained and looking
    round at his fellow competitors. Singh believes that these errors caused him to lose his medal
    opportunity and they are his "worst memory".Davis, Carl Kaufmann and Malcolm Spence all
    passed him, and a photo-finish resulted. Davis and Kaufman were both timed at a world-record
    breaking 44.9 seconds, while Spence and Singh went under the pre-Games Olympic record of 45.9
    seconds, set in 1952 by George Rhoden and Herb McKenley, with times of 45.5 and 45.6 seconds,
    respectively. The Age noted in 2006 that "Milkha Singh is the only Indian to have broken
    an Olympic track record. Unfortunately he was the fourth man to do so in the same race"
    but the official Olympic report notes that Davis had already equalled the Rhoden/McKenley
    Olympic record in the quarter-finals and surpassed it with a time of 45.5 seconds in the semi-finals.

At the 1962 Asian Games, held in Jakarta, Singh won gold in the 400 m and in the 4 × 400 m
    relay. He attended the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he was entered to compete in the 400 m,
    the 4 × 100 m relay and the 4 × 400 m relay.He did not take part in either the 400 m
    or the 4 × 100 m relay and the Indian team of Milkha Singh, Makhan Singh, Amrit Pal and
    Ajmer Singh were eliminated when they finished fourth in the heat stages of the 4 × 400 m.

There have been claims that Singh won 77 of his 80 races, but these are spurious.
    The number of races in which he participated is not verified, nor is the number of
    victories, but he lost a 400 m race at the 1964 National Games in Calcutta to Makhan Singh
    and he did not finish first in any of his four races at the 1960 Olympic Games or the
    aforementioned qualification races at the 1956 Olympics.

Singh's time in the 1960 Olympics 400 m final, which was run on a cinder track, set a national
    record that stood until 1998 when Paramjit Singh exceeded it on a synthetic track and with
    fully automatic timing that recorded 45.70 seconds. Although Singh's Olympic result of 45.6
    seconds had been hand-timed, an electronic system at those Games had determined his record to be 45.73.</p><hr>

<p>As of 2012, Singh lived in Chandigarh.He met Nirmal Saini, a former captain of the Indian women's
volleyball team in Ceylon in 1955; they married in 1962 and had three daughters and a son, the golfer 
Jeev Milkha Singh. In 1999, they adopted the seven-year-old son of Havildar Bikram Singh, who had died in 
the Battle of Tiger Hill.</p><hr>

    Singh was promoted from the rank of sepoy to junior commissioned officer in recognition of his
    successes in the 1958 Asian Games. He subsequently became Director of Sports in Punjab
    Ministry of Education, a post he retired from in 1998.Also in 1958, he was awarded the
    Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian award, following his success in 1958.

In 2001, he turned down an offer of the Arjuna Award from the Indian government, arguing that
    it was intended to recognise young sports people and not those such as him. He also thought
    that the award was being inappropriately given to people who had little notable involvement
    as active sports people at all, and had become devalued. While sharing his experience
    in a college in Goa in 2014, he stated, "I rejected the Arjuna I was offered after I received
    the Padma Shri. It was like being offered an SSC [secondary school] certificate after securing
    a Masters degree."
All of Singh's medals have been donated to the nation. They were displayed at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium
    in New Delhi and later moved to a sports museum in Patiala, where a pair of running shoes that
    he wore in Rome are also displayed. In 2012, he donated the Adidas shoes that he had worn in the
    1960 400 m final to be sold in a charity auction organised by actor Rahul Bose.

Singh was admitted to the intensive care unit at Fortis Hospital in Mohali on 24 May 2021 with pneumonia
    caused by COVID-19. His condition was, for a while, described as stable, but he died on 18 June 2021
    at 11:30 pm in Chandigarh. His wife, Nirmal Saini, had died a few days earlier on 13 June 2021,
    also due to COVID-19. Singh was laid on his funeral pyre with a photo of his wife in his hands.

    Singh and his daughter, Sonia Sanwalka, co-wrote his autobiography, titled The Race of My Life.
    It was published in 2013. The book inspired[37] Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, a 2013 biographical film
    of Singh's life. The film is directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, and stars Farhan
    Akhtar in the title role, with Sonam Kapoor, Meesha Shafi and Divya Dutta in female lead roles.
    The film was widely acclaimed in India and won awards including the National Film Award for
    Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the National Film Awards, and 5
    awards at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in 2014. The film made over ₹100 crores.
     Singh sold the movie rights for one rupee but inserted a clause stating that a share of the
    profits would be given to the Milkha Singh Charitable Trust. The Trust was founded in 2003 with
    the aim of assisting poor and needy sportspeople.

In September 2017, Singh's wax statue – created by sculptors of Madame Tussauds in London – was
    unveiled at Chandigarh. It depicts Singh in running posture during his victorious run at the
    1958 Commonwealth Games.The statue is placed at Madame Tussauds museum in New Delhi, India
    . After winning India's first track and field gold medal at the 2020 Olympics, Neeraj Chopra
    dedicated his victory to Singh.
